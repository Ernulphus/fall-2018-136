* Lab instructions:
** First time preparation
- Make a *private* GitHub repo named *csci13600-labs*
- Invite me as a collaborator with write priviliges (settings, collaborators & teams)
** For each lab
- Each lab will be in it's own directory under the *labs* folder in
  this repo. You can view it as a web page or clone this repo for
  updated starter and data files as appropriate.
- Create a new directory in your *csci13600-labs* repo with the exact
  same name as the lab you are completing (*lab_01*, *lab_02* etc.).
- Create a Readme.org or Readme.md file with any specific information
  you want to communicate to me with respect to the lab.
- You *must* commit and push the lab by the end of the lab period. If
  the final due date is extended beyond the class time, you must still
  push by the end of class and then update your repo by the final due
  date.
- Some labs might also be submitted to Gradescope using the directions
  supplied in 13500
